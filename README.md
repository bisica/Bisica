# Bisica

Bisica is an [iridescent](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence) theme
that is based of real world visible spectrum and appearance of
[bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth) and
[silicon carbide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide) crystal.
It is inspired by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) and IBM's
[Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).

## Philosophy

- **Iridescence** of bizmuth
- **Self-sustaining** of carbon
- **Consistency** of silicon
